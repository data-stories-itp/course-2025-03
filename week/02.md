### SOME NOTES ON DATA LITERACY\*

Data is a set of numerical values described by qualitative and quantitative variables.
Data visualizations (graphs, charts, maps and other creative visualizations) should:

- Have a clear title and purpose
- Provide insight into the data
- Make clear what the visualization represents
- Make it's intention clear within moments
- Reveal trends and patterns if they exist
- Provide easy access to insights into the data

In addition:

- If outliers in the data exist they should be easy to spot
- The completeness of the data should be explained
- A data literate consumer should be able to spot whether the author deliberately excluded or hid relevant data

In creating or examining visualizations ask:

- Can I answer all of my questions with what I see, or do I need more data?
- ​Is it clear what has been measured, and what the numbers represent?
- Are there helpful notes, labels, and navigational hints?
- Can the viewer gather useful and actionable data from this visualization?

### Week 02 Homework

<!-- 1. **Reflect on Week 2 class.** Think about whether you might like to contribute to building the project or creating a new piece of work for your final project. _Be prepared to discuss in class._-->


   <!-- This three-part podcast series exposes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC's) bungled response to COVID-19 in the early days of the pandemic and takes listeners inside the massive volunteer effort to collect data about tests, cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. The United States has 4% of the world’s population, but 16% of COVID-19 deaths. This podcast series investigates the failures that led to over 1 million Americans dying from COVID-19 and what that tells us about the nation’s ability to respond to the next pandemic. This three-part series was reported by Artis Curiskis and Kara Oehler and hosted by infectious disease expert Jessica Malaty Rivera. -->

Reflect on what you have learned so far about data literacy and the skills you have or would like to enhance.
Working with Data. Enhancing Data Literacy

Check the class Github/Notion for details about this week’s homework.  Last week you evaluated data vizzies through the lens of “art is a bridge between fact and feeling”.  This week, we would like you to enhance your data literacy skills and to analyze vizzies in the context of your improved data literacy

<!-- 5. **Choose a new data vizzies or one from last week's homework.**
 - Put screenshots, images (if from printed material) and links if relevant into your Week 2 Google folder.  

- Analyze the vizzie through the lens of data literacy as we discussed in class. For the vizzie you chose, write down your answers to the following questions:

- What is the source of the data?
- What does the chart/graph/visualization represent?
- Is there a clear title and purpose?
- Is the title informative/accurate/misleading/vague? COuld you suggest a more accurate or informative title?
- Can you understand the intent of the visualization in a few moments?
- Is there enough auxiliary information to help you decode the data? What auxiliary information is provided? How is it provided?
- Does the visualization allow you to access granularity?
- What insight into the data does the visualization provide?
- Do any particular patterns or trends emerge? If so, what are they? -->
